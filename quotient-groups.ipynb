    "In arithmentic, the *quotient* typically means the integer part of a division when one number is divided by another. In many programming languages, division of one integer by another automatically results in the quotient, with any fractional part (or remainder, to stay in integer arithmetic) being discarded. We usually think of quotient in these terms: as \"part of\" the result of a division operation. This basic idea hides a somewhat deeper idea, though: that of *equivalence classes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of thinking about parts disposed of during division, we can instead think about how quitienting makes some pairs of numbers \"the same\" when divided. For example, if we look at numbers in the range 1&ndash;19 when divided by 3, we get:"

Another way to look at this, though, is to say that, for the quotient, the result of (for example) `3 / 3` is the same as the results of `4 / 3` and `5 / 3`: the operation has taken several expressions and made them equivalent under the quotient."

    "* The underlying set is the set of positive and negative integers, and we're commiting the usual abuse of notation by using $\\mathbb{Z}$ for both\n",

    "* Every element $x$ has a corresponding inverse element $-x$ such that $x + (-x) = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "The group has several sub-groups. Let's construct a specific sub-group, the set of all even integers, which we'll denote $2\\mathbb{Z}$ (although it's also sometimes denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the literature). We can construct this group by multiply each number in $\\mathbb{Z}$ by two: just like $\\mathbb{Z}$ itself, $2\\mathbb{Z}$ is an infinite group.\n",

    "* $2\\mathbb{Z}$ must be closed under addition: it is, since the sum of two even integers is itself an even integer\n",

It's easy to see that there are actually only two unique cosets, consisting of the odd integers and the even integers. Let us denote these two sets $O$ and $E$ respectively. These cosets are the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. We can apply the operation elementwise, and find that $E + E = E$ while $E + I = I + E = I$, meaning that $E$ (the even integers) is the identity element of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. By contrast, $I + I = E$.\n",

If we can find another group with the same structure, we can use that group instead, and indeed map all operations in one group into the other automatically. The correct notion for \"with the same structure\" is a group isomorphism, which is simply two homomorphisms going in opposite directions between the two groups. The important point about homomorphisms is that they transform *both* the underlying set *and* the operation of one group to those of another in a way that maintains the values of (*respects*) the operation under the transformation.   \n",

The range of $ind$ is currently a set, but we can make it a group by providing it with an operation $+_2$ of addition modulo two, so $0 +_2 0 = 0$, $0 +_2 1 = 1$, and $1 +_2 1 = 0$. Let us denote this group by $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We can then extend $ind$ to be a group homomorphism that operates on the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ as $\\{ E \\mapsto 0, I \\mapsto 1 \\}$ and maps elementwise addition to addition modulo 2. If we check, then\n",

One could accurately say \"is (up to isomorphism)\". However, both of these in my opinion obscure what's actually going on, which is the construction of a group as a collectiuon of cosets &ndash; and only then simplifying to an isomorphic group with \"sensible\" elements.)\n"
